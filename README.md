Add your answer to this readme file, commit your changes to this repository.
```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      body {
        padding: 0px;
        margin: 0px;
      }
      .foo {
        top: 20px;
        left: 20px;
        width: 100px;
        height: 100px;
        position: absolute;
        background: blue;
      }
      .bar {
        top: 20px;
        left: 20px;
        width: 30px;
        height: 30px;
        position: absolute;
        background: yellow;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="foo">
      <div class="bar"></div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```
#### Your answer: It is 40px from top and left also. You have to add together both divs 20 pxs since bar, the yellow box is inside the foo div.[2p]


## 3. Explain concepts (~15 minutes) [4 points]
Add your answer to this readme file, commit your changes to this repository.


### Explain the difference between `display: block` and `display: inline` in CSS! What is `display: inline-block`?
#### Your answer: All elements have their default display type (block or inline), however in CSS we can specify it differently. The difference is that block level elements take up the whole space horizontaly while inline elements do not brake lines by default. Inline-block is the combination of them. They do not brake lines (until there is width for them) but also can have a width and height like a block element. [2p]


### What is the difference between a `<section>` and an `<article>` element? Name one good example of using an `<article>`.
#### Your answer: There is semantical difference between them. The section element is a thematic grouping of the content but only a part of the whole. While the article element is independently meaningful itself. An example is the wiki project where the whole text part is the article and we can divide them into smaller sections.  [2p]
